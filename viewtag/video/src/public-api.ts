/**
 * `ARVideoComponent` ships on its own entry point so that `video.js` stays a
 * genuinely optional peer dependency.
 *
 * It cannot live in the `/viewtag` barrel: the component statically imports the
 * Video.js loader, and a bundler resolves every specifier in a module graph at
 * build time — including the ones behind a lazy `import()`. Re-exporting it
 * alongside `ARImageComponent` therefore makes an image-only app fail to build
 * with `Can't resolve 'video.js/dist/video-js.css'`, even though it renders no
 * video and `peerDependenciesMeta` marks the package optional.
